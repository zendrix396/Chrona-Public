# Firebase Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit your actual Firebase credentials to GitHub

# Option 1: Set the path to your local credentials file
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./firebase-credentials.json

# Option 2: Set the credentials JSON directly as an environment variable (secure for production)
# Replace with your actual Firebase credentials
# FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS={"type": "service_account", "project_id": "your-project-id", "private_key_id": "...", ...}

# For development without Firebase, leave both variables empty/commented
